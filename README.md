# Module_13_Challenge

In this challenge, we were asked to test out a neural network with given parameters and then asked to alter those parameters to create two different models to see if we could increase the accuracy or decrease the loss of data.

My first alternative model had an extra hidden layer (3 in total) compared to the original and my second alternative model had an increase number of EPOCHS (increased from 50 to 100). Both decreased the accuracy and increased the loss percentage meaning they were both not as good as the original model.

We then exported all of the models as HDF5 files to save the models.
